(LEGACY) I no longer maintain this. Storing it in the legacy branch in case I need references to go back to.

### Installation

```
$ pnpm i
```

### Local Development

```
$ pnpm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ pnpm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
