Looking at everything that's happening, I decided to write a post about myself and the existence of this blog.

## Let me introduce myself

So for those of you who don't know who I am, I would like to introduce myself first. My name is Angga and as of the date this post is published, I am a 2nd year computer science student. What you're looking at right now is the blog section of my personal site. This is actually not my first personal site as I have made some multiple times in the past before. These are the ones I can remember:

- [https://nayyara-airlangga.github.io/personal-site/](https://nayyara-airlangga.github.io/personal-site/)
- [https://anggans.vercel.app](https://anggans.vercel.app)
- [https://nairlangga.vercel.app](https://nairlangga.vercel.app)

All of those sites was build based on what I was curious about. One site is made using Next.js and uses PostgresQL. One uses GraphCMS. One is just a static html site. This one is built using Docusaurus.

## Why Docusaurus?

I decided to use Docusaurus because I find it to be the easiest one to setup and use out of all of them. It allows me to write content and build custom pages quickly by utilizing their preset theme. It provides the right mix for me to do things quickly yet still provide some level of customizability.

_\*cough\*_

Ok now to the actual content of this post.

## To the heart of the matter

### Why does this blog exist?

So, why does this blog exist? Well, I've been blogging for about 2 years now on and off. Mostly off, but I discovered some time ago that I enjoy writing. I like to pour my ideas and stories into words for others and myself to read. I also like to share what I've learned and writing articles on a blog is how I like to do it.

### Why transition to this blog instead of your old ones?

Well, it's mainly because I was inspired by a mini-project I did. I was to create a simple company blog to share knowledge and gain traction. I didn't have a lot of time to spend on so developing from scratch would be out of the window
