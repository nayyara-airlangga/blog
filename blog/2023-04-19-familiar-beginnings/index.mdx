Seeing as this is the beginning for this site and me, I decided to write a post about myself and the existence of this site. Or is it?

## Let me introduce myself

So for those of you who don't know who I am, I would like to introduce myself first. My name is Angga and as of the date this post is published, I am a 2nd year computer science student. What you're looking at right now is the blog section of my personal site. This is actually not my first personal site as I have made some multiple times in the past before. These are the ones I can remember:

- [https://nayyara-airlangga.github.io/personal-site/](https://nayyara-airlangga.github.io/personal-site/)
- [https://anggans.vercel.app](https://anggans.vercel.app)
- [https://nairlangga.vercel.app](https://nairlangga.vercel.app)

All of those sites was build based on what I was curious about. One site is made using Next.js and uses PostgresQL. One uses GraphCMS. One is just a static html site. This one is built using Docusaurus.

## Why Docusaurus?

I decided to use Docusaurus because I find it to be the easiest one to setup and use out of all of them. It allows me to write content and build custom pages quickly by utilizing their preset theme. It provides the right mix for me to do things quickly yet still provide some level of customizability.

_\*cough\*_

Now, to the actual topic of this post.

## To the heart of the matter

### Why does this blog exist?

So, why does this blog exist? Well, I've been blogging for about 2 years now on and off. Mostly off, but I discovered some time ago that I enjoy writing. I like to pour my ideas and stories into words for others and myself to read. I also like to share what I've learned and writing articles on a blog is how I like to do it. It serves as a way for me to develop my thinking and to better express my thoughts into words.

All this feels somewhat familiar. I've done this sort of post multiple times already since I keep changing sites. But, I hope this will be the last. I plan on really sticking with this one.

### Why transition to this blog instead of your old ones?

Well, it's mainly because I was inspired by a mini-project I did. I was to create a simple company blog to share knowledge and gain traction. I didn't have a lot of time to spend on so developing from scratch would be out of the window. And I also want to make it as light as possible for everyone involved. With some research, I decided Docusaurus to be a perfect fit. The presets they provide is great and I can easily customize it as much as I need. It's also very trivial to write posts like this as they support MDX. Also, for my needs I don't need a CMS but you can also integrate this with one that is Git-based such as [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/) to make it easier for non-developers to write articles. And for the comments, I just used a service like [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) as it has all the things I would need for a blog such as comments, reactions, upvotes, etc.

For the deployment, I used Netlify as it's great to serve static contents like this and it has a simple authentication and authorization mechanism that's supported by Decap CMS. For my site, I don't need Decap CMS since that's mainly for non-developers but Netlify was so nice to use personally I used it anyway lol.

Overall, I'm pretty pleased with how it looks.

### What kind of content should we expect?

Well that's a good question. I will probably post a lot about tech and my own experiences with it but I'm also open to posting other things, including my personal views on certain things. I also plan on making this somewhat of a documentation of my own journey as a professional and as a person. I am a man who strives to be better each day and I would like to share my findings to the world as it may help others to do so too.

## To conclude...

I'm pretty excited right now because I finally found a stack that can make maintaining my personal site and blog much easier. I'm planning to add more features to this site in the future. As for this blog, it serves as a place for me to pour my thoughts and develop my own thinking. And so, I will end this with a segment of a quote that I find fitting.
