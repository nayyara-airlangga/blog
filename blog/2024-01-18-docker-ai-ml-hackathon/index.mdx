After our [achievement at GEMASTIK](/journey-to-gemastik-xvi), we decided to capitalize on the momentum and compete in another competition. Our eyes are set on a global-scale hackathon organized by [Docker on Devpost](https://docker.devpost.com). This competition lasted a month from October to November 2023. The theme revolves around using AI to solve problems related to developer experience and productivity. After going through the process of finding and validating ideas, we decided to build a product assistant to help product and engineering go through the requirement gathering, scoping and understanding process. We went on to winning an honorable mention with this product. How did we do it?

# Our framework

We used a similar framework to the one we used in GEMASTIK to build our solution. These are adapted from Dan Olsen's lean product process in his incredible book, ["The Lean Product Playbook"](https://leanproductplaybook.com/). To build a good product that solves real problems, we need to:

1. Identify our target users
2. Figure out their underserved needs
3. Define our value proposition
4. Specify the minimum set of features that will deliver the value proposition
5. Build the minimum viable product (MVP) based on the feature set
6. Test the MVP with customers

These steps ensure that we're building a solution, or at least a proof of concept for a real problem that users have and not just a toy product with no demand.

Quick note, I highly recommend that book for anyone looking to build products or businesses. Whether you're from product, engineering, or an entrepreuner, this book will help as a reference as you build for your users.

# Step 1: Identify our target users

This is quite easy as the hackathon description already said that they wanted to focus on developer productivity and experience.
